/*  Terninilogies:-
    A computer program is a sequence of statments designed to accomplish a certain task
    Programming is the creation of a program
    Syntax are the rules that specify if a statment/instruction is legal
    A programming language is a set of symbols along with rules governing the ise of those symbols
*/
/*  Cpp Program basics:-
    Programming instructions must be written according to syntax rules
    The compiler is responsible for converting code to machine level language
    Compiler checks that the program follows syntax rules
    A subprogram written to promote modularity and to avoid repetition of code
    Every Cpp program has 1 and ONLY 1 Function called main()

/*  Token
    A Token is smallest individual program unit
    Tokens can be divided into special symbols, word symbols and identifiers
    
    Special Symbols:- include mathematical symbols and punctuation marks
                        a blank space is also a special symbol
                        eg:- +/-*<><=>=?,:.

    Word Symbols:- also called reserved words or keywords
                    each reserved word has a specific meaning for the compiler and connot be used otherwise
                    reserved word s are always lowercase
                    eg:- int char float dounble void return
                    if else etc
    
    Identifiers:- names for variables and constants and functions
                    they can consist of only letters, digits or underscore character
                    must begin with letter or an underscore character
                    in cpp identifiers are case sensitive i.e. devtown is nor same as DevTown
                    keywords cannot be used as an identifier
                    eg:- name DevTownm salary t_min hours
